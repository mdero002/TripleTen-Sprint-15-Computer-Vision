# TripleTen-Sprint-15-Computer-Vision
The project aimed to develop a computer vision system for Good Seed, a supermarket chain, to assess the age of customers purchasing alcohol-based products. This system helps ensure compliance with alcohol laws and prevents underage sales. I built and evaluated a model to verify a customer's age from their photo, which is integral to this process.
